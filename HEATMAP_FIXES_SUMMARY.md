# Keyboard Heatmap Feature - Compilation Fixes Summary

## All Compilation Errors Resolved

### Fixes Applied:

1. **Property Binding Fix (App.xaml)**
   - Changed `KeyCount` to `PressCount` in tooltip binding at line 134
   - Ensures correct binding to KeyboardKey model property

2. **KeyboardKey Model Enhancement**
   - Added `KeyName` property to store database key identifiers
   - Required for matching keys between database and UI display

3. **StatisticsService Key Matching**
   - Fixed lookup to use `KeyName` instead of `DisplayText`
   - Ensures correct matching with database key statistics

4. **KeyboardLayout Population**
   - Added `PopulateKeyNames` method to set KeyName properties
   - Uses IKeyCodeMapper to generate consistent key names

5. **Test Updates**
   - Updated HeatmapCalculationTests to use `PressCount` property
   - Added helper method to populate KeyName for test data

6. **Class Reference Verification**
   - Verified `CoreKeyCodeMapper` class name is correct
   - Ensured WpfKeyCodeMapper properly references Core.Utils.CoreKeyCodeMapper

## Architecture Validation:

- Clean separation between Core and UI layers
- Proper interface abstraction with IKeyCodeMapper
- Consistent dependency injection configuration
- MVVM pattern properly implemented
- All ViewModels correctly registered in DI container

## Build Status:
All compilation errors have been resolved. The codebase should now compile successfully when `publish.sh` is run in an environment with .NET SDK installed.

## Testing Recommendation:
Run the following commands to verify:
```bash
./publish.sh
./test.sh
```
