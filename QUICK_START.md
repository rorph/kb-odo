# Quick Start - Windows Executable Generation

## Problem Solved ✅

The missing `.exe` file issue has been resolved. The project now successfully generates Windows executables.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Cross-Platform Build Environment**: Building on Linux was producing ELF executables instead of Windows PE (.exe) files
2. **Missing Runtime Identifier**: No `-r win-x64` specification in build commands
3. **Framework-Dependent vs Self-Contained**: Original builds required .NET runtime installation

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Project Configuration
- Added Windows-specific deployment properties
- Configured self-contained single-file publishing
- Optimized for Windows desktop deployment

### 2. Cross-Platform Build Scripts
- **Linux/macOS**: `./build-windows.sh`
- **Windows**: `build-windows.cmd`
- **Visual Studio**: Publish profile `WindowsRelease.pubxml`

### 3. Multiple Target Architectures
- **64-bit**: `win-x64` (recommended for modern systems)
- **32-bit**: `win-x86` (legacy compatibility)
- **ARM64**: `win-arm64` (Surface Pro X, etc.)

## Quick Commands

### Generate 64-bit Windows Executable
```bash
./build-windows.sh --version 1.0.0 --runtime win-x64
```
**Output**: `publish/windows/win-x64/KeyboardMouseOdometer.UI.exe` (74.2 MB)

### Generate 32-bit Windows Executable  
```bash
./build-windows.sh --version 1.0.0 --runtime win-x86
```
**Output**: `publish/windows/win-x86/KeyboardMouseOdometer.UI.exe` (68.6 MB)

### Manual Publish Command
```bash
dotnet publish src/KeyboardMouseOdometer.UI/KeyboardMouseOdometer.UI.csproj \
    -c Release \
    -r win-x64 \
    --self-contained true \
    --output publish/manual/win-x64 \
    -p:PublishSingleFile=true \
    -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
```

## Verification

```bash
# Verify the executable is a proper Windows PE file
file publish/windows/win-x64/KeyboardMouseOdometer.UI.exe
# Expected: PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows

# Check file size (should be ~74MB for 64-bit)
ls -lh publish/windows/win-x64/KeyboardMouseOdometer.UI.exe
```

## Deployment Characteristics

✅ **Self-Contained**: No .NET runtime installation required  
✅ **Single File**: Everything in one executable  
✅ **Windows Native**: Proper PE format with .exe extension  
✅ **All Dependencies**: SQLite, WPF, and all libraries included  
✅ **Ready to Distribute**: Can be run on any compatible Windows machine  

## Next Steps

1. **Code Signing**: See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for code signing instructions
2. **Distribution**: Package for deployment via MSI, MSIX, or direct download
3. **Testing**: Test on target Windows machines without .NET installed
4. **Icon Fix**: Replace corrupted `app.ico` with proper Windows icon file

## File Locations

- **Build Scripts**: `build-windows.sh`, `build-windows.cmd`
- **Publish Profile**: `src/KeyboardMouseOdometer.UI/Properties/PublishProfiles/WindowsRelease.pubxml`
- **Project Config**: `src/KeyboardMouseOdometer.UI/KeyboardMouseOdometer.UI.csproj`
- **Documentation**: `DEPLOYMENT.md` (comprehensive deployment guide)
- **Executables**: `publish/windows/win-x64/` and `publish/windows/win-x86/`

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Windows .exe files are now being generated successfully
