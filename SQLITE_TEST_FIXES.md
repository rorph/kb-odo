# SQLite Test Fixes for CI Environment

## Problem Analysis

The GitHub Actions CI was failing with 11 test failures showing the same pattern:
```
System.IO.IOException : The process cannot access the file 'C:\Users\runneradmin\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp*.tmp' because it is being used by another process.
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **SQLite WAL Mode**: SQLite uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode which creates `-wal` and `-shm` files that remain locked even after connection disposal
2. **Inadequate Connection Cleanup**: The original `DatabaseService.Dispose()` method only called `_connection?.Dispose()` without properly closing connections
3. **Missing SQLite Connection Pool Cleanup**: SQLite maintains connection pools that need explicit clearing
4. **Windows File System Delays**: Windows can have delays in releasing file handles, especially with antivirus scanning
5. **Garbage Collection Timing**: SQLite finalizers might not have run before tests attempt file deletion

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced DatabaseService.Dispose()
```csharp
public void Dispose()
{
    try
    {
        if (_connection != null)
        {
            // Ensure any pending transactions are completed
            if (_connection.State == System.Data.ConnectionState.Open)
            {
                _connection.Close();
            }
            
            _connection.Dispose();
            _connection = null;
        }
        
        // Force SQLite to release all resources
        SqliteConnection.ClearAllPools();
        
        // Trigger garbage collection to ensure finalizers run
        GC.Collect();
        GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger?.LogWarning(ex, "Warning during database service disposal");
    }
}
```

### 2. TestDatabaseFixture Base Class
Created a robust base class for database tests that:
- Supports both in-memory and file-based databases
- Implements comprehensive file cleanup with retry logic
- Handles SQLite WAL files (`-wal`, `-shm`, `-journal`)
- Uses forced garbage collection
- Gracefully handles cleanup failures

### 3. Default to In-Memory Databases
- Changed `DatabaseServiceTests` and `LifetimeStatsTests` to use `:memory:` databases by default
- This eliminates file locking issues entirely for most tests
- Created separate `FileDatabaseIntegrationTests` for scenarios that specifically need file persistence

### 4. Robust File Cleanup Strategy
- Multiple retry attempts with delays
- Cleanup of all SQLite-related files (main, WAL, SHM, journal)
- Graceful failure handling that doesn't break tests
- File renaming as last resort to avoid interference with subsequent tests

## Files Modified

1. `DatabaseService.cs` - Enhanced Dispose() method
2. `DatabaseServiceTests.cs` - Converted to use TestDatabaseFixture with in-memory DB
3. `LifetimeStatsTests.cs` - Converted to use TestDatabaseFixture with in-memory DB
4. `HourlyStatsTests.cs` - Minor cleanup to use proper using statement
5. `TestDatabaseFixture.cs` - New robust base class for database tests
6. `FileDatabaseIntegrationTests.cs` - New integration tests for file-based scenarios

## Expected Results

- Eliminates all 11 failing SQLite tests in GitHub Actions
- Maintains comprehensive test coverage
- Provides better separation between unit tests (in-memory) and integration tests (file-based)
- More reliable cleanup in CI environments
- Better error handling and logging for debugging

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Use in-memory databases for fast, isolated testing
- **Integration Tests**: Use file-based databases for persistence and concurrent access scenarios
- **CI Robustness**: Graceful cleanup failure handling prevents cascading test failures

The fix prioritizes CI reliability while maintaining comprehensive test coverage through a hybrid approach of in-memory databases for unit tests and file-based databases for integration scenarios.
