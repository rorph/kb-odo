# Keyboard Mouse Odometer - Troubleshooting Guide

## "The operation completed successfully" Error

This paradoxical error occurs when Windows APIs return success but the application still fails to initialize. Here's how to diagnose and fix it:

### Quick Diagnosis Commands

1. **Test Basic Functionality**:
   ```cmd
   test-basic.cmd
   ```
   This shows if WPF and .NET are working correctly.

2. **Diagnostic Mode**:
   ```cmd
   test-diagnostic.cmd
   ```
   Shows detailed startup logs and system information.

3. **Debug Mode**:
   ```cmd
   run-debug.cmd
   ```
   Runs with full error reporting and logging.

### Common Causes and Solutions

#### 1. Global Hook Permission Issues
**Symptoms**: Access denied errors, hooks fail to initialize
**Solutions**:
- Run as Administrator (right-click → "Run as administrator")
- Add exception in Windows Defender/antivirus software
- Check Windows Defender SmartScreen settings

#### 2. Security Software Interference
**Symptoms**: Hooks initialize but fail silently, unexpected crashes
**Solutions**:
- Temporarily disable antivirus/security software
- Add application folder to security software exclusions
- Check for HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System) blocks

#### 3. Missing Dependencies
**Symptoms**: DLL not found errors, runtime initialization failures
**Solutions**:
- Install Visual C++ Redistributable 2022 (x64)
- Install .NET 8.0 Runtime
- Run Windows Update

#### 4. Windows Defender SmartScreen
**Symptoms**: Application blocked from running, "unrecognized app" warnings
**Solutions**:
- Click "More info" → "Run anyway" when blocked
- Add application to SmartScreen exclusions
- Temporarily disable SmartScreen for testing

#### 5. Corrupted User Profile/Settings
**Symptoms**: Random failures, inconsistent behavior
**Solutions**:
- Delete application data folder: `%LocalAppData%\KeyboardMouseOdometer`
- Create new Windows user account for testing
- Run `sfc /scannow` to check system files

### Error Log Locations

The application saves detailed error logs to:
- **Startup Errors**: `%LocalAppData%\KeyboardMouseOdometer\startup-error.log`
- **Windows Event Log**: Applications and Services Logs → KeyboardMouseOdometer
- **Debug Output**: Visible in Visual Studio Output window or DebugView

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Enable Windows Event Logging
1. Open Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc)
2. Navigate to Windows Logs → Application
3. Look for KeyboardMouseOdometer entries
4. Check error details and event IDs

#### Process Monitor Analysis
1. Download Process Monitor (ProcMon) from Microsoft
2. Run ProcMon as Administrator
3. Start the application
4. Filter by process name: KeyboardMouseOdometer.UI.exe
5. Look for ACCESS DENIED or NAME NOT FOUND errors

#### Dependency Analysis
1. Use Dependency Walker (depends.exe) to check for missing DLLs
2. Run: `depends KeyboardMouseOdometer.UI.exe`
3. Look for missing or incompatible dependencies

### Command Line Options

- `--test` or `-t`: Test mode - shows basic functionality dialog
- `--diagnostic` or `-d`: Diagnostic mode - detailed startup information
- No arguments: Normal startup with enhanced error reporting

### Environment Information

When reporting issues, include:
- Windows version (`winver`)
- .NET version (`dotnet --info`)
- Antivirus software and version
- Error logs from the locations above
- Whether running as Administrator helps

### Contact and Support

If none of these solutions work:
1. Run in diagnostic mode and save the output
2. Check Windows Event Log for additional details
3. Include all error logs when reporting the issue
4. Specify your exact Windows version and security software

The enhanced error handling will provide much more detailed information about what's failing during startup.
